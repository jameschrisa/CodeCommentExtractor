# Code Comment Extractor

This project is a script that extracts comments from source code files written in C++, C, C#, Python, JavaScript, Go, PHP, and Java and converts the extracted comments into a JSON file organized by the type of language and the comments. The script takes a source code file as input and outputs a JSON file that contains all the comments found in the source code file, organized by language and comment type (single-line or multi-line). The output JSON file can be used for further processing and analysis of the comments in the source code file.
